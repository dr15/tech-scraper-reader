# Tech Scraper Reader

This project will scrape sources (Telegram channels, newsletters, blogs, etc.) for aggregated tech news, creating a single post out of each title-link pairs so that each item could be saved individualy for later reference.
Down the line this might also hold a simple RSS reader that will let users read, save and comment on posts.
